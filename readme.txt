== Description ==

This plugin is used to quickly add basic Facebook Social plugin features. Basic here means the features using iframe and does not use the SDK (XFBML)  / JavaScript. The recommendations, activity and like box features are provided as widgets.

This plugin is a very simple plugin to embed :

* "like" button at the end of your articles/blog posts
* activity feed as a widget
* recommendations as a widget
* Like box as a widget

You can add these cool features with minimal effort.

Most configuration parameters are self-explanatory, but Domain Override simply means you want to display information about another domain instead of where the widgets are hosted.

WARNING: Facebook changes might break this plugin any time.

== Installation ==

1. Make a directory `facebook-social-plugins` under `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Upload `facebook-social-plugins.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/facebook-social-plugins/` directory
